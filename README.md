NOTE: This project has been forked from [oauthjs/node-oauth2-server](https://github.com/oauthjs/node-oauth2-server) and is a continuation due to the project appearing to be abandoned. Please see [our issue board](https://github.com/node-oauth/node-oauth2-server/issues) to talk about next steps and the future of this project.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @node-oauth/oauth2-server
```

The `@node-oauth/oauth2-server` module is framework-agnostic but there are several officially supported wrappers available for popular HTTP server frameworks such as [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@node-oauth/express-oauth-server) and [Koa (not maintained by us)](https://npmjs.org/package/koa-oauth-server).
If you're using one of those frameworks it is strongly recommended to use the respective wrapper module instead of rolling your own.


## Features

- Supports `authorization_code`, `client_credentials`, `refresh_token` and `password` grant, as well as *extension grants*, with scopes.
- Can be used with *promises*, *Node-style callbacks*, *ES6 generators* and *async*/*await* (using [Babel](https://babeljs.io)).
- Fully [RFC 6749](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749.html) and [RFC 6750](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6750.html) compliant.
- Implicitly supports any form of storage, e.g. *PostgreSQL*, *MySQL*, *MongoDB*, *Redis*, etc.
- Support for PKCE
- Complete [test suite](https://github.com/node-oauth/node-oauth2-server/tree/master/test).

## Examples

Most users should refer to our [Express (active)](https://github.com/node-oauth/express-oauth-server) or 
[Koa (not maintained by us)](https://github.com/oauthjs/koa-oauth-server/tree/master/examples) examples.

## Version 5 notes

Beginning with version `5.x` we removed dual support for callbacks and promises.
With this version there is only support for Promises / async/await.

With this version we also bumped the `engine` to Node 16 as 14 is now deprecated.

## Migrating from OAuthJs and 3.x

Version 4.x should not be hard-breaking, however, there were many improvements and fixes that may
be incompatible with specific behaviour in <= 3.x

For more info, please read the [changelog](./CHANGELOG.md) or open an issue, if you think something
is unexpectedly not working.

## Supported NodeJs versions

This project supports the node versions along the
[NodeJS LTS releases](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/), focusing on

- Maintenance LTS
- Active LTS
- Current

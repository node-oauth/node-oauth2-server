 PKCE Support
================

Starting with release 4.3.0_ this library supports PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange by OAuth Public Clients) as
defined in :rfc:`7636`.

.. _4.3.0: https://github.com/node-oauth/node-oauth2-server/releases/tag/v4.3.0

The PKCE integrates only with the :ref:`authorization code <AuthorizationCodeGrant>`. The abstract workflow looks like
the following:

1. Authorization request
========================

.. _PKCE#authorizationRequest:

    A. The client creates and records a secret named the "code_verifier" and derives a transformed version "t(code_verifier)" (referred to as the "code_challenge"), which is sent in the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Request along with the transformation method "t_m".

The following shows an example of how a client could generate a `code_challenge`` and
``code_challenge_method`` for the authorizazion request.

::

    const base64URLEncode = str => str.toString('base64')
          .replace(/\+/g, '-')
          .replace(/\//g, '_')
          .replace(/=/g, '')

    // This is the code_verifier, which is INITIALLY KEPT SECRET on the client
    // and which is later passed as request param to the token endpoint.
    // DO NOT SEND this with the authorization request!
    const codeVerifier = base64URLEncode(crypto.randomBytes(32))

    // This is the hashed version of the verifier, which is sent to the authorization endpoint.
    // This is named t(code_verifier) in the above workflow
    // Send this with the authorization request!
    const codeChallenge = base64URLEncode(crypto.createHash('sha256').update(codeVerifier).digest())

    // This is the name of the code challenge method
    // This is named t_m in the above workflow
    // Send this with the authorization request!
    const codeChallengeMethod = 'S256'

    // add these to the request that is fired from the client

In this project the authorize endpoint calls OAuth2Server.prototype.authorize which itself uses AuthorizeHandler.
If your Request body contains code_challenge and code_challenge_method then PKCE is active.

::

    const server = new OAuth2Server({ model })

    // this could be added to express or other middleware
    const authorizeEndpoint = function (req, res, next) {
      const request = new Request(req)
      req.query.code_challenge        // the codeChallenge value
      req.query.code_challenge_method // 'S256'

      server.authorize(request, response, options)
        .then(function (code) {
          // add code to response, code should not contain
          // code_challenge or code_challenge_method
        })
        .catch(function (err) {
          // handle error condition
        })
    }

2. Authorization response
=========================

.. _PKCE#authorizationResponse:

    B. The Authorization Endpoint responds as usual but records "t(code_verifier)" and the transformation method.

The ``AuthorizeHandler.handle`` saves code challenge and code challenge method automatically via ``model.saveAuthorizationCode``.
Note that this calls your model with additional properties ``code.codeChallenge`` and ``code.codeChallengeMethod``.


3. Access Token Request
=======================

.. _PKCE#accessTokenRequest:

    C. The client then sends the authorization code in the Access Token Request as usual but includes the "code_verifier" secret generated at (A).

This is usually done in your token endpoint, that uses ``OAuth2Server.token``.

::

    const server = new OAuth2Server({ model })

    // ...authorizeEndpoint

    // this could be added to express or other middleware
    const tokenEndpoint = function (req, res, next) {
      const request = new Request(req)
      request.body.code_verifier // the non-hashed code verifier
      server.token(request, response, options)
            .then(function (code) {
              // add code to response, code should contain
            })
            .catch(function (err) {
              // handle error condition
            })
    }

Note that your client should have kept ``code_verifier`` a secret until this step and now includes it as param for the token endpoint call.


    D. The authorization server transforms "code_verifier" and compares it to "t(code_verifier)" from (B). Access is denied if they are not equal.

This will call ``model.getAuthorizationCode`` to load the code.
The loaded code has to contain ``codeChallenge`` and ``codeChallengeMethod``.
If ``model.saveAuthorizationCode`` did not cover these values when saving the code then this step will deny the request.

See :ref:`Model#saveAuthorizationCode` and :ref:`Model#getAuthorizationCode`

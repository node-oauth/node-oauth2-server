  # STEP 1 - NPM Audit

  # Before we even test a thing we want to have a clean audit! Since this is
  # sufficient to be done using the lowest node version, we can easily use
  # a fixed one:

  audit:
    name: NPM Audit
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '14'
    # install to create local package-lock.json but don't cache the files
    # also: no audit for dev dependencies
    - run: npm i --package-lock-only  && npm audit --production

  # STEP 2 - basic unit tests

  # This is the standard unit tests as we do in the basic tests for every PR
  unittest:

    - name: Setup node ${{ matrix.node }}
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}

    # for this workflow we also require npm audit to pass
    - run: npm i
    - run: npm run test:coverage

    # with the following action we enforce PRs to have a high coverage
    # and ensure, changes are tested well enough so that coverage won't fail

  # STEP 3 - Integration tests

  # Since our release may affect several packages that depend on it we need to
  # cover the closest ones, like adapters and examples.

  integrationtests:
    name: Extended integration tests
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: [unittest]
    strategy:
      matrix:
        node: [14, 16, 18] # TODO get running for node 16

    # checkout this repo
    - name: Checkout ${{ matrix.node }}
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: ${{ matrix.node }}

    # in order to test the adapter we need to use the current checkout
    # and install it as local dependency
    # we just cloned and install it as local dependency
    - run: |
        cd github/testing/express
        npm i
        npm install ../../../
        npm run test

    # todo repeat with other adapters
